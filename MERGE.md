4. **Intuitive Controls**: RAG toggle, keyboard shortcuts, better visual feedback
5. **Persistent Settings**: User preferences saved across sessions

### **Improved RAG Performance**  
Your original query "de que trata el capitulo 2 del manual del conductor" should now:
- Successfully find content about Chapter 2
- Return relevant chunks with lower similarity scores  
- Provide better context for AI responses with documentation prefix
- No longer return "Sorry, I don't know" when content exists
- Show responses like: "💡 Based on your documentation: Chapter 2 covers..."

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after merging:

1. **Check the debug endpoint** for detailed analysis
2. **Verify document upload** - ensure the PDF was properly processed
3. **Check logs** for any errors during retrieval
4. **Test with different query variations** to see which work best

# Merge Instructions: Fix Button Variant TypeScript Error

## Overview
Fixed a TypeScript build error in the KnowledgeManager component where an invalid Button variant `"default"` was being used. The Button component only accepts `"primary"`, `"secondary"`, `"ghost"`, and `"outline"` variants.

## Changes Made
- **File**: `frontend/components/chat/KnowledgeManager.tsx`
- **Line**: 441
- **Change**: Changed `variant="default"` to `variant="primary"` for the "Overwrite" button
- **Reason**: The "Overwrite" action is a primary action in the duplicate file dialog, making `"primary"` the semantically correct variant

## How to Merge

### Option 1: GitHub Pull Request (Recommended)
1. Push the branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin fix/button-variant-typescript-error
   ```

2. Create a Pull Request:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select `fix/button-variant-typescript-error` → `main`
   - Title: "Fix: Replace invalid Button variant 'default' with 'primary'"
   - Add description explaining the TypeScript error fix
   - Assign reviewers and merge when approved

### Option 2: GitHub CLI
```bash
# Push the branch
git push origin fix/button-variant-typescript-error

# Create and merge PR using GitHub CLI
gh pr create --title "Fix: Replace invalid Button variant 'default' with 'primary'" \
  --body "Fixed TypeScript error where 'default' is not a valid Button variant. Changed Overwrite button to use 'primary' variant which resolves Vercel build failure." \
  --base main \
  --head fix/button-variant-typescript-error

# Merge the PR (after review if required)
gh pr merge --squash
```

## Verification
After merging, verify the fix by:
1. Deploying to Vercel (should now build successfully)
2. Testing the Knowledge Manager duplicate file dialog to ensure the "Overwrite" button still functions correctly

## Impact
- ✅ Resolves Vercel build failure
- ✅ Maintains existing functionality
- ✅ Uses semantically correct button variant
- ✅ No breaking changes
