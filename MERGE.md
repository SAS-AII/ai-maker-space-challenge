# RAG Integration with Qdrant Cloud - Merge Instructions

## 🎯 **Feature Overview**
This branch (`feature/qdrant-rag-integration`) adds comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality using Qdrant Cloud as the vector database, integrating with aimakerspace components for PDF processing, text chunking, and embeddings.

## 📋 **Prerequisites Before Merging**

### 1. **Environment Variables**
Ensure these are set in your environment:
```bash
QDRANT_URL=your_qdrant_cloud_url
QDRANT_API_KEY=your_qdrant_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### 2. **Dependencies**
Install the new backend dependencies:
```bash
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Test the Integration**
Before merging, test these key features:
- PDF upload via knowledge uploader
- RAG-enabled chat responses
- Knowledge base search functionality

## 🔄 **Merge Options**

### **Option A: GitHub Pull Request (Recommended)**
1. Push the feature branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/qdrant-rag-integration
   ```

2. Create a Pull Request:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "Compare & pull request"
   - Title: "Add RAG Integration with Qdrant Cloud"
   - Description: Include the feature overview and testing instructions
   - Request review from team members

3. After approval, merge using GitHub's interface

### **Option B: Direct Merge with GitHub CLI**
```bash
# Ensure you're on the feature branch
git checkout feature/qdrant-rag-integration

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/qdrant-rag-integration

# Create PR via GitHub CLI
gh pr create --title "Add RAG Integration with Qdrant Cloud" --body "
## Features Added
- Qdrant Cloud integration for vector storage
- PDF document ingestion using aimakerspace
- RAG-enabled chat with knowledge base search
- Knowledge management UI with drag-and-drop upload
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Testing
- Upload PDF documents via sidebar
- Enable RAG toggle in chat header
- Ask questions about uploaded documents
- Verify context-aware responses

## Technical Details
- Uses Cosine distance for text similarity
- Temporary file cleanup (no local storage)
- Serverless-ready architecture
- Rich metadata support
"

# Merge the PR
gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch
```

### **Option C: Direct Merge (Use with Caution)**
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the feature branch
git merge feature/qdrant-rag-integration

# Push to main
git push origin main

# Clean up feature branch
git branch -d feature/qdrant-rag-integration
git push origin --delete feature/qdrant-rag-integration
```

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] API endpoints accessible at `/api/v1/knowledge/*`
- [ ] PDF upload works via sidebar knowledge uploader
- [ ] RAG toggle appears in chat header
- [ ] RAG-enabled responses include context from uploaded documents
- [ ] Knowledge base stats endpoint returns collection info
- [ ] Error handling works for invalid files/API issues
- [ ] UI responsive on mobile and desktop

## 📁 **Files Changed**
### Backend
- `api/requirements.txt` - Added Qdrant dependencies
- `core/qdrant_client.py` - Qdrant Cloud client
- `rag/` - New RAG package (ingest, retrieve, prompts)
- `api/knowledge.py` - Knowledge management endpoints
- `api/app.py` - Enhanced chat with RAG support

### Frontend
- `frontend/components/chat/KnowledgeUploader.tsx` - New upload component
- `frontend/components/chat/ChatSidebar.tsx` - Added knowledge section
- `frontend/components/chat/ChatContainer.tsx` - Added RAG toggle

## 🔧 **Configuration Notes**
- Collection name: `knowledge_base`
- Distance metric: `COSINE` (optimal for text embeddings)
- Chunk size: 1000 characters with 200 overlap
- Vector size: 1536 (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)

## 🚀 **Post-Merge Actions**
1. Deploy to production environment
2. Update documentation with RAG usage instructions
3. Monitor Qdrant Cloud usage and performance
4. Consider adding more file types (Word docs, text files)

## 📞 **Support**
For issues or questions about this integration:
- Check logs for Qdrant connection errors
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure OpenAI API key has sufficient credits
- Test with small PDF files first
