# RAG System Improvements - Merge Instructions

## Overview
This branch contains comprehensive improvements to the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to fix issues with document retrieval and answer generation.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Better Search Parameters**
- Lowered default score threshold from 0.7 to 0.3 for more inclusive retrieval
- Increased default search limit from 5 to 10 results
- Increased context size from 4000 to 6000 characters
- Increased max chunks from 5 to 8

### 2. **Query Expansion**
- Added intelligent query expansion for Spanish chapter/section queries
- Supports patterns like "cap√≠tulo 2", "de qu√© trata", "qu√© dice"
- Automatically generates alternative phrasings for better retrieval

### 3. **Improved Document Processing**
- Enhanced text cleaning that preserves document structure
- Smart text splitting (1500 chars vs 1000) with better overlap (300 vs 200)
- Chapter/section detection and metadata preservation
- Natural boundary splitting to avoid breaking important content

### 4. **Multiple Threshold Strategy**
- Implements fallback thresholds (0.3, 0.2, 0.1) for better coverage
- Ensures retrieval even with lower similarity scores

### 5. **Better Context Organization**
- Groups results by filename for better context flow
- Maintains document order within chunks
- Improved similarity score reporting

### 6. **Debug Tools**
- Added comprehensive debug endpoint `/api/v1/knowledge/debug-comprehensive`
- Tests multiple thresholds and query expansion
- Provides detailed analysis of retrieval results

## Testing the Improvements

### 1. **Test with Your Original Query**
Use the new debug endpoint to test your specific query:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/knowledge/debug-comprehensive" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "query=de que trata el capitulo 2 del manual del conductor"
```

### 2. **Check Query Expansion**
The system should now expand your query to:
- "de que trata el capitulo 2 del manual del conductor"
- "cap√≠tulo 2"
- "chapter 2"
- "capitulo 2"
- "secci√≥n 2"
- "tema 2"

### 3. **Test Different Thresholds**
The debug endpoint will show results for thresholds: 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1

git branch -d feature/improve-rag-retrieval
```

## Post-Merge Testing

After merging, test the improvements:

1. **Restart your API server** to ensure changes are loaded
2. **Test the original query** that was failing
3. **Use the debug endpoint** to verify query expansion is working
4. **Check that more relevant content** is being retrieved

## Expected Results

With these improvements, your query "de que trata el capitulo 2 del manual del conductor" should now:
- Successfully find content about Chapter 2
- Return relevant chunks with lower similarity scores
- Provide better context for the AI to generate accurate answers
- No longer return "Sorry, I don't know" when content exists

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after merging:

1. **Check the debug endpoint** for detailed analysis
2. **Verify document upload** - ensure the PDF was properly processed
3. **Check logs** for any errors during retrieval
4. **Test with different query variations** to see which work best

## Files Modified

- `rag/retrieve.py` - Enhanced retrieval with query expansion
- `rag/ingest.py` - Improved document processing and chunking
- `api/knowledge.py` - Updated endpoints with better defaults
